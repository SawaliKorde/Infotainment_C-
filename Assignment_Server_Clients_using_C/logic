for generating random data

bus id - 1
scale - 1-500
device id - 1 - means temp sensor
device ids are fixed - 1,2,3 i.e. - 1 for temp, 2 - pressure sensor, 3 - for rpm sensor
so define these protocols for de_id


Server keeps writing to shared memory
check the size and clear that size if 4096/4096

now when client connects
client sends query to server - dev_id - 1, bus_id - 1 
server sends all the data to client having dev_id - 1 and bus_id - 1


now client reads this data and starts writing to the file
now write the logic to check file size
if file size exceeds than 10mb then compress the file and fast copy to some location

Client logic
Client should send request like - devid and busid
client should listen and receive the bufffer ffrom server
client should write to a file
if the file size becomes 10mb then compress it and write to other file
