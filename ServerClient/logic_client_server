socket connect
map update with socket number but no msg so?
client send message

map<int> socket_id

4
5
6

tell client to write message like = "1:hi"
break the string
compare 1 with map lookup
if found send that message to that id client




{4,5,6,7} - set
1:hi
breakk string - 1
look up in set
if yes
send msg to that particular client

//Approach
2 clients are connected to server
1,2,3 - are counter ids
4,5,6 - are socket descriptor of particular client
server stores id and socket_descriptor of client1 during connections
map <int, int> target -> {{1:4},{2:5},{3:6}}
client 1 send msg like "5:message"
this string goes to server
that message is stored in string message ---> storeddd
compare 5 from  message in map if it matches in map ie {2:5}
it picks from map that is client 2 socket dp 5 using this info it sends data to client2 without showing in server terminal

Client code approach
We have two functions
Send message
-> taking message from command line and send to server

REceive message function
-> receive function receives message from  server 


Threading
Receive function has its own thread
Send function is directly called

Formatting
display function 
in client terminal show like "Client_DP_ID_{id}: while message receiving
add cout statements wherever required
add error handling 


display panel
dp id - displaying correct
address
thread id
client status - flag iff true show connected if false show disconnected 

atomic<bool>status;
