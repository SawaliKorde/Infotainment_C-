Instead of Copy/Print all 1000 pages and give to X simply give the original book =>Pass by reference

#include <stdio.h>
Typedef struct {
	Char book[100];
Char pages[1000];
}book;
//Pass by value
Void editbook(book book) { copy of the book is changed, original remains intact - There are two copies in RAM}
//Pass by pointer
Void editbookviapointer(book *book){ directly modify the original - There is only one copy in Memory}
Int main() {
Book mybook;
editbook(mybook);
editbookviapointer(&mybook);
Return 0;
}
