/* What this code does ? It takes the CLASS diagram as seen in the PpT and implements it in C++ to show, all OOPS CONCEPTS

OOPS concept 			Used
Encapsulation			Classes, School, Student, Staff, Room and Activity
Inheritance				Administration inherits from staff
Polymorphism			Staff and Admin used in the context
Abstraction				School, Room
Composition				School contains student, staff, room and activity
Association				Relationships between school, students, staff, blah blah
Dynamic Binding			Used to resolve methods at runtime, this is done by calling the constructor


For arrays or linked lists : We need to manage the memory, size, elements and blah blah
Instead, CPP gives us Standard Templates, that do all these tasks. We will use them and save us the headache of management */


Flow of writing code:
include header files
define classes


Classes and Relationships : Classes School,Student, Staff,Administrationm Room and Activity		
							Administration inherits from staff
							
Encapsulation : Private data members in the School CLASS
				Controlled access through methods using addStudent,addStaff ...
Polymorphism : when adding staff and administration using pointers
			We used dynamic_cast to identify Administration object
			
Dynamic Memory Management: Using the "new" for staff objects.
