setup a shared memory of 4096 bytes

a) Have the server as a producer of data. The server will write once every 3 seconds
b) The clients will read them at their own interval
	TCP Clients will read every 1 second
	CAN BUS clients will read every 2 seconds
	PROFIBUS clients will read every 5 seconds

c) Data structure to be used:
	devdata
	{
		int devid;	=>Device id
		int protocol; 	=>TCP,CAN,PROFIBUS
		string devname; =>name of the device (TP-> temperature, pressure, or FLowMeter, voltage, rpm
		double devreading;
		int busid;
	}


d) use ENUM for protocol

e) Bus ID = connector on which the data comes from => Two ->Primary that will work by default, secondary that will take over if the primary is down and vice versa
