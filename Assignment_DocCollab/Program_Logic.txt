using simple vectors
server has a vector defined for taking input from client
so that in orderly manner user data can be written to file
also queueing mechanism required if 2 clients write at one time
for example :- client1 and client2 connected at same time to server then threads safety is done to avoid race condition
in vector_message = [client1msg, client2msg] --> server
then server process the message from queue and write to shared memory and file itself and also notify the clients that "document is modified"


thread logic
one thread for handleclient
one thread for write to shared memory
one thread for display status
one thread for write to file
